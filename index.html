        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p> I am a recovering accountant (who sometimes relapses during tax season), who decided that
          a second act as a developer would be a great way to lose whatever sanity I have left.
          I am the daughter of a GM Systems Analyst, and the granddaughter of one of the original
          'punchcard girls' at the University of Chicago's first computer lab, so you could say that code is in my
          genes.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not working, I'm gardening, quilting, playing with dogs, reading, and hanging out with my hubby.
          I also travel frequently. I was in 6 cities on two continents just last month!
